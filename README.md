The easiest way to find a character most commonly used in the array is to create a character map and return the key with the largest value. This function is an attempt to do the same, but without creating a character map, instead just by manipulating the array itself. The function takes an array of letters in the form of strings as an argument and returns the most commonly used letter as well as how many times it has been encountered in the array.
